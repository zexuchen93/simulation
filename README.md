Digital System Simulation  --  Course project<br>
Simmer is a powerful tool to be used in simulate simple discrete stochastic events. A typical case of Rsimmer usually includes following elements: generator, resource, trajectory, arrival, activity and so on. In this project, we will discuss a US army development case, which involved with plane arrangement, time calculation and route optimization.
